# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This file contains a brief descrition of my project0 file.
There are four pages: 
    1.Home
    2.My Blog
    3.About Me
    4.Resume

Each of the above files have 4 reference links to each other. This is in fr of unordered list 
An Image is added to the Home
The website contain total 3 stylesheets files. 
styling.css is used for my_blog. It stylizes the table, it also adds the mobile-responsive @media query
As a result, the backgroung colour changes of resume.html changes upon varying the width. Try it out!

#id and .class part is exected in the 'My Blog' page, the lorem ipsum lines.
The table part is also executed in my blog.

I have also included the bootstrap.css file, and used its component: card. It is excecuted in the About me part
Also I have created 3 bootstrap columns for layout purposes using Bootstraps Grid Models, in the About Me part

All the required part(variables, inheritance, nesting) regarding SCSS is done in the resume.html part
For this style.scss and style.css files are used.

Also, just for exploring, I embedded a PDF viewer for my resume.pdf file in the resume.html

I hope I have satisfactorily completed the project0.
Any critics/suggestions are welcome!

Thanks and Regards
